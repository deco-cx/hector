# AI App Builder Design Document

## 1. Overview

The AI App Builder, named "Hector," is a no-code platform designed to empower users to create, manage, and run custom AI-powered applications.

By leveraging a step-by-step configuration process, users can define an app's visual style, input fields, AI-driven actions, and output formats.

The platform integrates with the Webdraw AI SDK, which offers
- Easy access to multiple AI models
- A filesystem for each user to server as database.
- Rhe generation of various content types, including text, images, audio, and more.

This design document outlines the app's functionality, user interface, data model, and technical integrations, providing a comprehensive blueprint for development.

It should work similarly to create Zaps on Zapier, but simples, mobile-friendly and AI-oriented.

## 3. User Flows

### 3.1 Creating a New App

1. **Initiate Creation**:
   - User clicks the "New App" button on the dashboard.

2. **Select Template**:
   - User chooses a template (e.g., "Form," "Quiz (WIP)"). Don't worry about quiz, just making it here to allow other types of app in the future.

3. **Configure Styleguide**:
   - User selects a visual theme (e.g., "Minimalistic," "Cyberpunk," "Classic") to define colors, fonts, and overall style.

4. **Define Inputs**:
   - User specifies input fields (e.g., "Filename," "Title," "Type") with options like "Text," "Image," etc., determining what data the app collects. There can be Select fields where user will configure options. This is similar to creating a Form on Google Forms, but simples.

5. **Set Up Actions**:
   - User adds AI-driven actions (e.g., "Gerar Texto" [Generate Text], "Gerar Imagem" [Generate Image]) and configures them with prompts or parameters.
   - New actions can be added. They're mostly a mapping to Webdraw SDK AI methods. Check more info in [./explain/webdraw-sdk.md](./explain/webdraw-sdk.md).

6. **Configure Output**:
   - User defines how generated content is displayed or exported (e.g., referencing files like "@cover.png," "@story.md"). The output is a static form with text, audio, image, video that the user can fill. Later it'll be possible to pass anything.

7. **Save App**:
   - The app configuration is saved as a JSON file in the ~/Hector/apps/ directory using the Webdraw SDK filesystem.

### 3.2 Editing an Existing App

1. **Select App**:
   - User selects an app from the "My Apps" list and clicks "Edit."

2. **Modify Configuration**:
   - User updates the template, style, inputs, actions, or output as needed.

3. **Save Changes**:
   - The updated configuration overwrites the existing JSON file in the Webdraw filesystem.

### 3.3 Running an App

1. **Select App**:
   - User selects an app from "My Apps" and clicks "Run."

2. **Enter Inputs**:
   - User provides data for the input fields defined in the configuration.

3. **Generate Output**:
   - User clicks "Generate" to execute the actions and produce the output.

4. **View or Export Output**:
   - The generated content is displayed, with options to download or share.

### 3.4 Exporting an App

1. **Select App**:
   - User selects an app and clicks "Export."

2. **Generate Export**:
   - The app configuration is packaged for sharing or standalone deployment. This feature will be implemented in a future version.

### 4.4 Actions Configuration

**Purpose:**  
Configures the AI-driven actions that the app will perform, such as generating text, images, or audio based on user inputs.

**Functionality:**

-   **Add Action:** Users can add actions from a list of available types:
    -   **Generate Text:** Creates text content using AI models (.md files)
    -   **Generate JSON:** Creates structured JSON data (.json files)
    -   **Generate Image:** Creates image content (.png files)
    -   **Generate Audio:** Creates audio content (.mp3 files)
  
-   **Action Configuration:** Each action has a card-based interface with:
    -   **View Mode:** Shows a summary of the action with its type, output filename, and prompt
    -   **Edit Mode:** Provides a form for configuring the action's properties
  
-   **Configure Action:** Each action has common properties and type-specific properties:
    -   **Action Type:** The type of content to generate (Text, JSON, Image, Audio)
    -   **Action Title:** A descriptive name for the action
    -   **Output Filename:** Auto-generated from the title with appropriate extension (.md, .json, .png, .mp3)
    -   **Schema-based Form:** Dynamic configuration form generated from JSON Schema for each action type
    -   **Prompt:** Users define the AI prompt, referencing input fields or previous actions with @filename.ext notation
    -   **Additional Properties:** Specific to each action type (e.g., model, temperature, max tokens for text)
    -   **Schema Field (JSON Actions):** For JSON generation actions, users can define a JSON schema directly in a text field or use the "Use AI" button to generate a schema automatically. When the "Use AI" button is clicked, a specialized implementation uses the generateObject API with a meta-schema to produce valid JSON Schema documents based on the user's description.
    -   **Model Selection (Text and JSON):** For text and JSON generation, users can choose from a variety of AI models including general options (Best, Fast) and specific provider models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Deepseek, Mistral, etc.)
      
-   **Available Variables Component:** 
    -   Displays all available variables that can be referenced in the prompt
    -   Shows input fields and outputs from previous actions with appropriate icons and labels
    -   Allows users to click on a variable to insert its reference (@filename.ext) into the prompt field
    -   Visually distinguishes between input fields and different types of action outputs using color-coded tags
    -   Automatically updates based on the current action being edited to only show relevant variables

-   **Schema-driven Forms:** Action-specific configuration forms are automatically generated using React JSON Schema Form:
    -   Forms adapt to each action type's schema
    -   Fields include appropriate validation
    -   Specialized widgets for different data types (text areas for prompts, sliders for numeric values, etc.)
    -   Consistent user experience across all form fields
      
-   **AI Schema Generation:** For JSON actions, the platform provides specialized AI-powered Schema generation:
    -   **Use AI Button:** Located alongside the Schema field to invoke AI-powered schema generation
    -   **Object Generation API:** Uses a specialized API to create properly structured JSON Schema documents
    -   **Descriptive Interface:** Users describe the data structure they want to create in natural language
    -   **Fallback Mechanism:** Automatically falls back to text-based generation if object generation fails
    -   **Validation:** Ensures the generated schema conforms to JSON Schema standards
      
-   **Multiple Actions:** Users can chain multiple actions, with each action potentially using outputs from previous ones.
  
-   **Reference System:** Actions can reference both input fields and outputs from previous actions using the @filename.ext notation in prompts.

**Visual Elements:**

-   Cards for each action with summary in view mode and configuration form in edit mode
-   "Add Action" section with cards for each available action type
-   Dynamically generated form fields for action properties (common and type-specific)
-   Interactive prompt field with available variables component showing clickable variable references
-   Toggle buttons to switch between view and edit modes
-   Auto-generated output filename display (non-editable)
-   Informative tooltips for each property

### 4.4 Output Configuration

**Purpose:**  
Defines how the app's generated content is presented or exported to the user.

**Functionality:**

-   **Template Selection:** Users can add output templates (currently only "Story" template is available) through a card-based interface similar to Actions.
  
-   **Template Configuration:** Each template has fields that reference files generated by actions:
    -   **Story Template:** Has optional fields for backgroundImage, title, content, and audio.
    -   **Title Field:** The title field is localized by language and serves as the default field displayed in the card view.
  
-   **File References:** Users select files using dropdowns that only show compatible files (e.g., image fields only show image files).
  
-   **Template Limits:** Users can only add one instance of each template type.
  

**Visual Elements:**

-   Large buttons with icons for adding different template types.
  
-   Form interface for configuring template fields (without the card flip effect used in Actions).
  
-   Dropdown selectors for each field showing only compatible files from inputs and actions.
  
-   Disabled add buttons for template types that have already been added.

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 App Configuration JSON

Each app is stored as a JSON file in ~/Hector/apps/ using the Webdraw filesystem. Below is an example structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_app_id",
  "name": "Example App",
  "template": "form",
  "style": "minimalistic",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "filename": "child_name.md",
      "type": "text",
      "title": {
        "EN": "Child's Name",
        "PT": "Nome da CrianÃ§a"
      },
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter the child's name"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Gerar Texto",
      "prompt": {
        "EN": "Generate a story for @child_name.md",
        "PT": "Gere uma histÃ³ria para @child_name.md"
      },
      "output_filename": "story.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "Gerar Imagem",
      "prompt": "Create a cover for @child_name.md's story",
      "output_filename": "cover.png"
    },
    {
      "type": "Gerar JSON",
      "prompt": "Generate a product catalog for @store_name.md",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "products": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "name": { "type": "string" },
                "price": { "type": "number" },
                "category": { "type": "string" }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "model": "Best",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "output_filename": "catalog.json"
    }
  ],
  "output": {
    "type": "html",
    "template": "story_template.html",
    "files": ["@cover.png", "@story.md", "@story.mp3"]
  }
}
```

- **id**: Unique identifier for the app.
- **name**: User-defined app name.
- **template**: Selected template (e.g., "form").
- **style**: Chosen visual theme.
- **inputs**: Array of input fields with properties.
- **actions**: Array of AI actions with configurations.
- **output**: Defines how results are presented or exported.

```json
// Updated output structure
"output": [
  {
    "type": "Story",
    "title": {
      "EN": "My Story Title",
      "PT": "TÃ­tulo da Minha HistÃ³ria"
    },
    "backgroundImage": "@cover.png",
    "content": "@story_content.md",
    "audio": "@narration.mp3"
  }
]
```

## 6. Integration with Webdraw AI SDK

The app uses the Webdraw AI SDK to perform AI-driven actions and manage file storage. Key methods include:

- **Gerar JSON**: Maps to generateObject() for structured data generation.
- **Gerar Texto**: Maps to generateText() for text generation.
- **Gerar Imagem**: Maps to generateImage() for image creation.
- **Gerar AÃºdio**: Maps to generateAudio() for audio production.

### 6.1 AI Object Generation for Schema Creation

The application leverages the Webdraw SDK's Object Generation API to create JSON Schema definitions for JSON actions. This specialized implementation ensures that generated schemas are valid and properly structured.

**Implementation Details:**
- **generateObject()**: The system uses this specialized API endpoint with a meta-schema to generate valid JSON Schema documents
- **Schema Generation Flow**:
  1. User clicks "Use AI" button next to the Schema field
  2. A modal appears for Schema generation
  3. User enters a description of the data structure they need
  4. The system detects that this is a Schema field for a JSON action
  5. It calls generateObject() with a meta-schema that includes a jsonSchema property
  6. If successful, the generated schema is extracted from the response and formatted as JSON
  7. The formatted schema is inserted into the Schema field
  8. If unsuccessful, the system falls back to text generation with specific instructions

- **Benefits**:
  - More accurate and valid JSON Schemas compared to text-based generation
  - Proper schema structure with correct types, validations, and nested objects
  - More intuitive interface for users who may not be familiar with JSON Schema syntax
  - Enhanced reliability with fallback mechanisms

- **Technical Implementation**:
  - The system detects Schema fields in JSON actions via field ID and title
  - Uses a specialized meta-schema with a jsonSchema object property
  - Comprehensive error handling with fallback to text generation
  - Proper JSON formatting with indentation for better readability
  - Clear success/error messages to guide users

### 6.2 Example Payload Configuration

For "Gerar Texto":

```typescript
{
  prompt: "Generate a story for @child_name.md",
  model: "text-model",
  maxTokens: 500
}
```

For "Gerar JSON":

```typescript
// Current implementation for JSON schema creation
// Note: Currently using regular text generation instead of specialized Object Generation
{
  // Regular text generation to create a schema string
  prompt: "Create a JSON schema for a product catalog with name, price, and category fields",
  model: "Best", 
  temperature: 0.7
  // Result is a text string that needs to be valid JSON Schema
}

// JSON generation with the created schema:
{
  model: "Best",
  prompt: "Generate a product catalog for a sports store",
  schema: JSON.parse(schemaString), // Schema is parsed from the string stored in the action config
  temperature: 0.7
}

// FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION (proposed for specialized schema generation):
{
  // Meta-schema for generating a valid JSON Schema
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      jsonSchema: {
        type: "object",
        description: "A valid JSON Schema defining the structure of objects"
      }
    }
  },
  prompt: "Create a JSON schema for a product catalog with name, price, and category fields",
  model: "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
  temperature: 0.7
}
```

For "Gerar JSON":

```typescript
// Schema generation using Object Generation API:
{
  // Meta-schema for generating JSON Schema
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      jsonSchema: {
        type: "object",
        description: "A valid JSON Schema defining the structure of objects"
      }
    }
  },
  prompt: "Create a JSON schema for a product catalog with name, price, and category fields",
  model: "Best",
  temperature: 0.7
}

// JSON generation with the created schema:
{
  model: "Best",
  prompt: "Generate a product catalog for a sports store",
  schema: JSON.parse(schemaString), // Schema is parsed from the string stored in the action config
  temperature: 0.7
}
```

The UI allows users to configure these payloads through React JSON Schema Form, an advanced form generation library that automatically builds forms based on JSON Schema definitions. This approach:

1. Creates consistent, well-structured forms for each action type
2. Handles validation automatically based on schema properties
3. Simplifies form state management
4. Provides a better user experience with appropriate input widgets for different data types

Each action type has a corresponding JSON Schema that defines its configuration options, allowing for clear separation between the UI and data model.

### 6.2 Authentication

Authentication is handled by the Webdraw SDK. The application can check for a logged-in user with:

```typescript
const user = await SDK.getUser(); // Returns { username: string } if user is logged in
```

## 7. Validation and Error Handling

### 7.1 Configuration Validation

- Ensures all required input fields are defined.
- Verifies action configurations (e.g., valid prompts).
- Disables the "Run App" button until the configuration is valid.

### 7.2 Runtime Error Handling

- Catches failures in AI generation (e.g., service downtime).
- Displays user-friendly error messages (e.g., "Failed to generate text. Please try again.").

## 8. Storage

- **App Configurations**:
  - Saved as JSON files in ~/Hector/apps/ using the Webdraw SDK filesystem.
  - Retrieved using SDK.fs.list('~/Hector/apps').filter(endsWithJson).

- **Generated Files**:
  - Stored in the Webdraw filesystem and referenced in the output configuration (e.g., "@story.md").

## 9. Internationalization

- **Language Support**:
  - UI and app content support multiple languages (e.g., English "EN," Portuguese "PT").
  - Language selection toggles titles, prompts, and descriptions (e.g., "Child's Name" vs. "Nome da CrianÃ§a").

## 10. Technical Implementation

### 10.1 Frontend Architecture

- The application is a frontend-only Single Page Application (SPA) with browser routing.
- The Webdraw SDK is imported and runs in an iframe.
- Ant Design provides the UI components and styling system, ensuring a modern and responsive interface.

### 10.2 Additional Features

- **Collapsible Sections**:
  - Configuration UI uses collapsible panels to manage screen space.

- **Templates**:
  - Predefined templates (e.g., "Form," "Quiz") streamline app creation, with "Quiz" marked as Work in Progress (WIP).

- **Export Format**:
  - The export functionality will be implemented in a future version, with a placeholder function that will call AI for this purpose.

    -   **Generate JSON:** Creates structured JSON data (.json files)
    -   **Generate Image:** Creates image content (.png files)
    -   **Generate Audio:** Creates audio content (.mp3 files)
  
-   **Action Configuration:** Each action has a card-based interface with:
    -   **View Mode:** Shows a summary of the action with its type, output filename, and prompt
    -   **Edit Mode:** Provides a form for configuring the action's properties
  
-   **Configure Action:** Each action has common properties and type-specific properties:
    -   **Action Type:** The type of content to generate (Text, JSON, Image, Audio)
    -   **Action Title:** A descriptive name for the action
    -   **Output Filename:** Auto-generated from the title with appropriate extension (.md, .json, .png, .mp3)
    -   **Schema-based Form:** Dynamic configuration form generated from JSON Schema for each action type
    -   **Prompt:** Users define the AI prompt, referencing input fields or previous actions with @filename.ext notation
    -   **Additional Properties:** Specific to each action type (e.g., model, temperature, max tokens for text)
    -   **Schema Field (JSON Actions):** For JSON generation actions, users can define a JSON schema directly in a text field or use the "Use AI" button to generate a schema automatically. When the "Use AI" button is clicked, a specialized implementation uses the generateObject API with a meta-schema to produce valid JSON Schema documents based on the user's description.
    -   **Model Selection (Text and JSON):** For text and JSON generation, users can choose from a variety of AI models including general options (Best, Fast) and specific provider models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Deepseek, Mistral, etc.)
      
-   **Available Variables Component:** 
    -   Displays all available variables that can be referenced in the prompt
    -   Shows input fields and outputs from previous actions with appropriate icons and labels
    -   Allows users to click on a variable to insert its reference (@filename.ext) into the prompt field
    -   Visually distinguishes between input fields and different types of action outputs using color-coded tags
    -   Automatically updates based on the current action being edited to only show relevant variables

-   **Schema-driven Forms:** Action-specific configuration forms are automatically generated using React JSON Schema Form:
    -   Forms adapt to each action type's schema
    -   Fields include appropriate validation
    -   Specialized widgets for different data types (text areas for prompts, sliders for numeric values, etc.)
    -   Consistent user experience across all form fields
      
-   **AI Schema Generation:** For JSON actions, the platform provides specialized AI-powered Schema generation:
    -   **Use AI Button:** Located alongside the Schema field to invoke AI-powered schema generation
    -   **Object Generation API:** Uses a specialized API to create properly structured JSON Schema documents
    -   **Descriptive Interface:** Users describe the data structure they want to create in natural language
    -   **Fallback Mechanism:** Automatically falls back to text-based generation if object generation fails
    -   **Validation:** Ensures the generated schema conforms to JSON Schema standards
      
-   **Multiple Actions:** Users can chain multiple actions, with each action potentially using outputs from previous ones.
  
-   **Reference System:** Actions can reference both input fields and outputs from previous actions using the @filename.ext notation in prompts.

**Visual Elements:**

-   Cards for each action with summary in view mode and configuration form in edit mode
-   "Add Action" section with cards for each available action type
-   Dynamically generated form fields for action properties (common and type-specific)
-   Interactive prompt field with available variables component showing clickable variable references
-   Toggle buttons to switch between view and edit modes
-   Auto-generated output filename display (non-editable)
-   Informative tooltips for each property

### 2.4 Output Configuration

**Purpose:**  
Defines how the app's generated content is presented or exported to the user.

**Functionality:**

-   **Template Selection:** Users can add output templates (currently only "Story" template is available) through a card-based interface similar to Actions.
  
-   **Template Configuration:** Each template has fields that reference files generated by actions:
    -   **Story Template:** Has optional fields for backgroundImage, title, content, and audio.
    -   **Title Field:** The title field is localized by language and serves as the default field displayed in the card view.
  
-   **File References:** Users select files using dropdowns that only show compatible files (e.g., image fields only show image files).
  
-   **Template Limits:** Users can only add one instance of each template type.
  

**Visual Elements:**

-   Large buttons with icons for adding different template types.
  
-   Form interface for configuring template fields (without the card flip effect used in Actions).
  
-   Dropdown selectors for each field showing only compatible files from inputs and actions.
  
-   Disabled add buttons for template types that have already been added.

----------

## 3. Running Screen

**Purpose:**  
Allows users to interact with their configured app by providing inputs and generating outputs.

**Functionality:**

-   **Dynamic Input Form:** Generates input fields based on the app's configured inputs (e.g., text boxes, file uploaders).
  
-   **Generate Button:** Triggers the execution of all configured actions using the provided inputs.
  
-   **Output Display:** Shows the generated content (e.g., text, images, audio) in a user-friendly format.
  
-   **Download/Share Options:** Provides buttons to download the output or share it via a link or file export.
  

**Visual Elements:**

-   Form with dynamically generated input fields.
  
-   "Generate" button to run the app.
